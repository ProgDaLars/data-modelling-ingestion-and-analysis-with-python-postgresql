# data-modeling-ingestion-and-analysis-with-python-postgresql

This work features travel datasets comprising of flight bookings, hotel bookings and the users. Includes data modelling, ingestion and analysis tasks on the datasets using Python and SQL, PostgreSQL as the database.

Programming: OOP python and reusable functions which simplified the flow and enhanced readability - code runs in a plug-and-play manner, provided you meet all software and libraries requirements and have all files in same directory.

Few useful insights extracted includes, but not limited to :

- Most visited destinations (overall)
- Most visited destinations (yearly)
- Total monthly travel (yearly)
- Peak travel months (overall)
- Peak travel months (yearly)
- Yearly travel and hotel booking spendings
- Unified travels and returns reports
and some more.

This dataset would be visualized in Tableau and would be updated in my GitHub repository. 

Dataset is publicly available on Kaggle via https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leomauro/argodatathon2019.
